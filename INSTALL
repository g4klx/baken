The Makefile for this package assumes that your libraries are in some sort
of standard places. By default GTK+ installs itself in /usr/local/lib,
whereas I forced it to install into /usr/lib on my system. This should not
be a problem.

To build baken, type:

make

and then:

make install

This will install the baken program into /usr/bin, the map and city files
into /usr/share/baken, the beacon file into /var/baken, and the system wide
configuration file into /etc. The path of the these files is hard coded into
the program, so if you decide to install it elsewhere then you will need to
modify the Makefile and rebuild the programs.

If you already have baken installed, you can choose to install only parts
of the package. By default "make install" will install everything, but using 
"make install-prog" will install the programs, "make install-data" will
install the satellite data, location data and the default user profile data,
"make install-map" will install the map.

Typing "make clean" will purge the baken distribution of unwanted crud.
"make uninstall" will delete the baken program and all its data files.
